## Why we left the MailFlow fork network

Inboxora began as a fork of [`maathimself/mailflow`](https://github.com/maathimself/mailflow), but
the two projects no longer share a direction. Staying inside the fork network misrepresented the
project, so the active repository was rebuilt as a standalone repository — 1:1, with the same
commits, branches, tags and release assets — and this one was archived.

The reasons, in short:

- **Inboxora is its own project, not a MailFlow derivative.** It has an independent release line
  (4.x), its own database migration chain, its own conversation engine, calendar, contacts and
  rebuilt UI. Nothing in it tracks upstream any more.
- **No more misleading attribution.** GitHub presented the project as "forked from
  `maathimself/mailflow`" and offered fork and upstream-sync behaviour that never matched how the
  code is actually maintained.
- **Full control of repository settings.** A standalone repository owns its releases, branch
  policy, Actions permissions and secrets outright, with no network-level defaults or "sync fork"
  prompts shown to users.
- **An independent fork network.** Repositories in one network share Git objects with each other;
  a standalone repository keeps the project's objects, refs and pull-request surface
  self-contained.
- **Downloads point at a canonical repository.** Releases, installers and source archives are
  re-published in the standalone repository, so nothing user-facing depends on the fork
  relationship.

### Why not simply use "Leave fork network"?

GitHub only offers the in-place *Leave fork network* action for forks that have no child forks.
This repository has one, owned by a third party, which we deliberately did not modify or delete.
Because archiving is permanent and history must not be lost, the active project was re-created as
a standalone repository instead. The commits, branches and tags here are identical to those in
[Dragonk/Inboxora](https://github.com/Dragonk/Inboxora).

</p>

Inboxora brings mail, contacts and calendars into one self-hosted application. It speaks
standard protocols — IMAP, SMTP, CardDAV, CalDAV — so your data stays on your server and
your existing devices keep working.

This release is a large step beyond the upstream MailFlow fork it started from: Inboxora
adds a real conversation engine for email threading, a full calendar with invitations,
first-party contacts with CardDAV/CalDAV access, and a rebuilt interface. See
[What's new in 4.0](#whats-new-in-40) for the full picture. Version 4.0.3 is a reliability
release: it fixes physical-copy identity after the Message-ID relocation era, hardens explicit
IMAP IDLE and folder-freshness handling, and ships the antispam v0.2 layer (deterministic rules
plus a per-user Naive Bayes model with opt-in auto-move). See the
[4.0.3 release notes](docs/wiki/Release-notes-4.0.3.md) for upgrade requirements.

</p>

## Highlights

- **Email with real threading.** Gmail, Outlook/Microsoft 365 and generic IMAP accounts feed a
  server-side conversation engine: a message and its replies become one logical conversation,
  with physical copies tracked per folder and per account. Expand a thread inline in the list,
  or read the whole conversation in the reading pane with per-message actions.
- **Calendar that works with your mail.** Local writable calendars with month, week, work-week
  and agenda views, recurring events with time-zone-aware expansion, event descriptions rendered
  like message bodies, invitations sent by email with retry, and invitations received by mail
  added to a calendar in one click.
- **Contacts with real interoperability.** Rich vCard fields, Google CSV import, Google CSV /
  Outlook CSV / vCard export, and read-only CardDAV address books.
- **CalDAV and CardDAV access through application passwords.** Dedicated, revocable app
  passwords — never your login password — so DAVx5, Thunderbird and iOS/Android clients sync
  contacts and calendars even on accounts protected by TOTP or SSO.
- **A rebuilt interface for desktop and phone.** Ink and its new Dark ink counterpart, separate
  default themes for the light and dark appearance, self-hosted fonts, resizable panels,
  drawer navigation, safe-area-aware mobile layout and system Back handling.

## Screenshots

Captured from the running application in one consistent style, on desktop (1440×900) and phone
(390×844). The complete set lives in [`media/screenshots/`](media/screenshots/) and is
regenerated by CI, so it always shows the current interface.

## What's new in 4.0

**4.0.3 is the current release.** It is a reliability release: physical-copy identity, explicit
IMAP IDLE and folder-freshness handling, the antispam v0.2 layer and frontend hardening. Before
production rollout, apply the listed database migrations (`0094`–`0100`) in order and pin the
published `4.0.3` image tag. See the
[4.0.3 release notes](docs/wiki/Release-notes-4.0.3.md).

4.0.0 is a major version because Inboxora is no longer only a mail client. Everything below
is new or rebuilt relative to the upstream MailFlow fork; the area-by-area changelog is in
[`docs/CHANGELOG.md`](docs/CHANGELOG.md), and the exhaustive per-change comparison against
upstream is published with the release tag.

- **Conversation engine.** Server-side threading with logical messages, per-folder physical
  copies, provider thread mapping (Gmail `X-GM-THRID`, Outlook `Thread-Index`, generic IMAP),
  manual merge/split/lock overrides, threading diagnostics and a dry-run rebuild.
- **Two independent threading views.** A threaded message list and a whole-conversation reader,
  each switchable on its own.
- **Calendar.** Local calendars, four views, recurrence with exceptions, event editing, email
  invitations with delivery retry, incoming invitation cards, read-only CalDAV/ICS sources and
  a generated Contact dates calendar.
- **Contacts and DAV.** First-party address books with rich vCard fields, CSV/vCard import and
  export, CardDAV server and client, CalDAV server, and revocable DAV application passwords.
- **Interface.** The Ink-based layout with resizable panels, per-module navigation, a rebuilt
  mobile shell, and self-hosted typography.
- **Platform reach.** Installable PWA with an unread badge and Web Push, a Windows Electron
  desktop application, and a native Android/Capacitor application. Android instant notifications
  use the bundled **ntfy** (UnifiedPush) server in the same stack — no Firebase, no second
  hostname. See [Platforms](#platforms) and
  [Notifications](https://github.com/Dragonk/Inboxora/wiki/Notifications).

## Platforms

- **Web / PWA.** The self-hosted web app, installable from the browser, with Web Push (VAPID)
  notifications and an unread badge. Works in any modern browser.
- **Desktop.** An Electron application for Windows (the same packaging also builds Linux and
  macOS artifacts). It wraps the web app, keeps the session, and supports the host picker, tray,
  `mailto:` links and the update checker.
- **Android.** A native Capacitor application with instant notifications. Android notifications
  go through **UnifiedPush**, so a compatible distributor app must be installed on the phone —
  the recommended one is **ntfy**. The Docker stack already ships the ntfy server on the same
  domain, so no second hostname or certificate is needed. Without a distributor the app still
  works and mail syncs, but notifications while the app is closed are not delivered.

See [Notifications](https://github.com/Dragonk/Inboxora/wiki/Notifications) for the phone setup
and [Installation](https://github.com/Dragonk/Inboxora/wiki/Installation) for the server side.

## Quick start

Docker Compose with pre-built images is the recommended deployment.

```bash
mkdir inboxora && cd inboxora
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dragonk/Inboxora/main/docker-compose.ghcr.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dragonk/Inboxora/main/.env.example
# edit .env: APP_URL, SESSION_SECRET, DB_PASSWORD, ENCRYPTION_KEY
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `APP_URL` and create the first account. The forms need three secrets, each generated
with `openssl rand -hex 32` (or `-hex 16` for `DB_PASSWORD`):

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_URL` | The public URL users open; used for invitation links, OAuth callbacks and cookies. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Signs session cookies. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Password for the bundled PostgreSQL. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypts stored mail and DAV credentials at rest. **Losing it makes saved credentials unreadable.** |

The same `docker compose up -d` also starts **ntfy**, the self-hosted UnifiedPush server for
Android instant notifications, running on the same domain at the `${APP_URL}` origin. One domain,
one certificate, no extra configuration.

Optional: `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` / `VAPID_SUBJECT` for Web Push, and
`DOMAIN` / `ACME_EMAIL` when Inboxora terminates TLS itself. Set `PUSH_BASE_URL` plus the
`docker-compose.external-ntfy.yml` override to use your own external ntfy instead. See the
[Installation](https://github.com/Dragonk/Inboxora/wiki/Installation) wiki page for the full
matrix, including running behind an existing reverse proxy.

## Coming from MailFlow?

An existing MailFlow deployment can be moved to Inboxora **without losing mail, accounts, rules,
contacts or preferences**.

> **Only MailFlow 3.3.0 is supported as a migration source.** Newer versions have not been tested.

The upgrade is a database migration that only adds: the 50 schema migrations MailFlow 3.3.0 ships
are byte-for-byte identical in Inboxora, which adds its own on top. Before you start, keep your
original `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `DB_NAME` and `DB_USER`, and bring the stack up from the directory that
holds your volumes — Inboxora's compose file uses `inboxora` as its database default, and a new
database name on an existing volume is the usual reason a migrated instance looks empty.

The full procedure, including the in-place and dump-and-restore routes and how to group existing
mail into conversations afterwards, is in
[**Migrating from MailFlow**](docs/wiki/Migrating-from-MailFlow.md).

## Connecting your accounts

- **IMAP/SMTP** — any provider, with Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud and custom presets.
- **Gmail** — connect with a Google **app password**; Inboxora uses IMAP/SMTP with it.
- **Microsoft 365 / Outlook.com** — OAuth2 (authorization code or device code). An administrator
  registers one Azure application under **Settings → Integrations**.
- **Contacts and calendars on your devices** — generate an application password under
  **Settings → DAV access** and point DAVx5, Thunderbird or a native client at your Inboxora URL.
  Use your Inboxora username with that app password; login passwords and TOTP codes are never
  used for DAV.

## Feature tour

<details>
<summary><strong>Email</strong></summary>

- Multiple IMAP/SMTP accounts with per-account colours, sender names, aliases (send-as with
  Reply-To and per-alias signatures) and signatures.
- Unified inbox across chosen accounts, per-folder and per-account unread counts, and unified
  search across every included account.
- Native conversation threading plus a server-side conversation engine, with a threaded list
  and a whole-conversation reader as independent preferences.
- Rich or plain-text composing, reply/reply-all/forward with correct `In-Reply-To` and
  `References`, attachments and inline images, drafts saved to the IMAP Drafts folder, and
  idempotent sending that never delivers twice on a retry.
- Rules and a block list, manual spam/ham handling, one-click `List-Unsubscribe`, snooze,
  archive, move, star and bulk actions with undo.
- Full-text search with operators such as `from:`, `to:`, `subject:`, `has:attachment`,
  `is:unread`, `after:` and `before:`.
- Sandboxed HTML rendering with remote images blocked by default, an allow-list per address or
  domain, a raw-headers viewer and in-message find.
- Live updates over IMAP IDLE and a WebSocket event stream, plus optional Web Push.
- Command palette, rebindable keyboard shortcuts, and optional AI summarisation/compose help.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Calendar</strong></summary>

- Month, week, work-week and agenda views with a day agenda that follows calendar visibility.
  All-day and multi-day events stretch across every day they cover in the week grids.
- Local writable calendars plus read-only calendars from CalDAV and ICS/webcal sources. A
  subscription is added by URL, or as a one-click Thunderbird public-holiday feed, from
  **Settings → Calendar**.
- Recurring events (`RRULE`, `RDATE`, `RECURRENCE-ID`, `EXDATE`) projected server-side with
  per-event time zones; editing a single occurrence preserves the series.
- Event descriptions edited as rich text and rendered through the same sanitised pipeline as
  message bodies.
- Invitations sent as an ICS email from a chosen SMTP account, with `SEQUENCE` handling,
  cancellation on attendee removal, and a retry action when delivery fails.
- Invitations received by mail surface as a card in the reader with **Add to calendar**; the
  local copy never sends an RSVP and is updated by UID and organizer.
- A generated **Contact dates** calendar turns contact birthdays and anniversaries into all-day
  yearly events, including dates stored without a year.
- Anonymous read-only `.ics` feed links that can be rotated or revoked.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Contacts and DAV</strong></summary>

- Multiple local address books plus read-only CardDAV books, with visibility filters and search
  that survives switching books.
- Rich vCard fields: names, nickname, typed emails and phones, organisation, job title, role,
  URLs, instant messages, structured addresses, categories, notes, photos and multiple
  labelled dates.
- Google CSV import into local books, and Google CSV, Outlook CSV and vCard 3.0 export.
- CardDAV and CalDAV servers with `.well-known` discovery, ETag/If-Match conflict detection,
  sync tokens with tombstones and client-chosen resource filenames.
- Revocable application passwords for DAV clients, listed with creation and last-use times.
- A CardDAV client that pulls a remote server (for example Nextcloud) into read-only local books.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Interface, mobile and platform</strong></summary>

- Desktop layout with independently resizable panels, shared list width across Mail, Contacts
  and Calendar, and a compact layout below 1100 layout pixels.
- Mobile shell below 767 px with a top bar, navigation drawer, floating action buttons,
  safe-area insets and system Back handling that closes in-app layers before leaving the PWA.
- Nine interface languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese
  (Simplified), Polish and Czech.
- ~25 themes with a separate default for the light and the dark appearance, a theme mode that
  follows the system or forces one appearance, multiple font pairings, a font-size scale from
  80 % to 130 %, five reader layouts and configurable swipe actions. **Ink** is the default
  light theme and **Dark ink** its dark counterpart, so a fresh profile follows the system and
  switches between the two on its own.
- Installable PWA with an unread badge and push notifications, an Electron desktop application
  for Windows, and a native Android application with instant UnifiedPush (ntfy) notifications.

## Development

```bash
# frontend
cd frontend && npm ci && npm test && npm run lint && npm run build

# backend
cd backend && npm ci && npm test && npm run lint
```

Browser coverage uses Playwright and runs the full mocked suite plus visual comparisons:
`cd frontend && npx playwright install chromium && npm run test:e2e`. Documentation screenshots
are generated on demand with `DOCS_SCREENSHOTS=1 npx playwright test e2e/docs-screenshots.spec.ts`;
see [`docs/wiki/Development.md`](docs/wiki/Development.md).

## Security

Inboxora is meant to sit behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS; do not publish the internal
host ports directly. Keep `.env` out of source control and never paste app passwords, tokens or
deployment secrets into issues, screenshots or the Wiki. To report a vulnerability, follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue with exploit details.
